Parameters
==============


Par_AnnualEmissionLimit
--------------
**Limits the maximum amount of Emissions in a year. [Megatonnes]**

Enables the user to set a maximum amount of emissions across all sectors for each model year. This can be used, for example, to gradually reduce emissions and reach a net-zero target in a specific year. `Carbon Budget Calculator <https://carbonbudgetcalculator.com/>`_  is a resource to generate different scenarios. 

Par_AnnualExogenousEmission
--------------

**Amount of external Emissions for a year in a certain region. [Megatonnes]**

This parameter allows the user to add exogenous emissions to the model that would otherwise not be captured but are intended to be accounted for in the model setup. These can include emissions from, for example, cement production, international air travel, and agriculture.
