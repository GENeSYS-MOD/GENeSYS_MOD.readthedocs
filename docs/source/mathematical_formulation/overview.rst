Overview
========

The Global Energy System Model (GENeSYS-MOD) is a framework for the computation of developments for the energy system including both dispatch as well as investment decisions across multiple years. The focus is usually on creating cost-optimal strategies for the decarbonization of the energy system across its multiple sectors (typical coverage includes buildings, transport, industry, and electricity). This then specifically includes the integration of renewable energy sources into the system, alongside sector coupling, flexibility options, energy transmission, etc.

GENeSYS-MOD has been in development since 2016, when it was first created as a fork of the Open-Source Energy Modeling System (`OSeMOSYS  <http://www.osemosys.org/>`_).

The model has since been featured in a wide range of academic research papers and projects (see :doc:`references </references>`). It now includes multiple repositories, spanning an entire ecosystem around the actual model core.
