Welcome to the GENeSYS-MOD documentation!
===================================

**The Global Energy System Model (GENeSYS-MOD)** is an open source energy system model available in both GAMS and Julia. It is a fork and extension of the Open Source Energy Modelling System (OSeMOSYS).

Here, you can find some quick start guides on both languages of the model, as well as detailed documentation of all settings, parameters, variables, and features.
