Release Notes
=============

GENeSYS-MOD has had several changes and expansions over time. The image below shows some of the key additions across the multiple major versions of GENeSYS-MOD.
The naming scheme of GENeSYS-MOD versions is as follows: major model versions (v1.x / v2.x) highlight a fundamental change in underlying data structure that is not cross-compatible. This means that GENeSYS-MOD v1.0 data sets would not be compatible with the GENeSYS-MOD v2.0 model code without modifications. This is usually due to a large change in the fidelity of input data (e.g. going from 6 time slices in v1.0 to 16 in v2.x to a flexible time series in v3.0+).
