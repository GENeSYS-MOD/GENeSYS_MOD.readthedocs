# Summary

GENeSYS-MOD is a flexible framework to model energy systems at various degrees of detail, with a focus on sector coupling and the computation of long-term pathways for the energy system.  

# Statement of need

Energy system models are powerful tools that can help answer 
The Global Energy System Model (GENeSYS-MOD) has been 

# General framework structure

Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$

You can also use plain \LaTeX for equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
\hat f(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{i\omega x} dx
\end{equation}
and refer to \autoref{eq:fourier} from text.

## Overview over the functionality and capabilities of GENeSYS-MOD

Figure \autoref{fig:inputs_outputs} shows some of the core inputs and outputs of the model.
